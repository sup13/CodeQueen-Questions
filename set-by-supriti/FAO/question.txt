Food and Agriculture Organization of U.N. has got the work of estimating the expenditure/earning of a farmer from his N by N acres of land.The estimation period is D days long.The land is divided into squares of unit area.At the beginning of estimation period,the investment of the farmer over any square piece of land as well as his earning from the piece of land is sero.Now you are given the statistics over D days of the period in the format- R1 C1 R2 C2 Cost, which means that the farmer invests/earns an amount of Cost rupees from a rectangular piece of land(made up of unit square pieces) with R1,C1 being the extreme top-left square piece and R2,C2 being the extreme bottom-right unit square piece of the rectangular piece of land.A positive value of Cost signifies an earning and a negative value signifies an expenditure. Your senior officer asks you a series of Q questions of the form- R1 C1 R2 C2 as a part of estimation process and you have to calculate the farmer's net expenditure/earning E from a rectangular piece of land(made up of unit square pieces) with R1,C1 being the extreme top-left square piece and R2,C2 being the extreme bottom-right square piece of the rectangular piece of land.But the senior official doesn't want to know the value of E,rather he wants you to have some fun!!He wants you to tell him the value of (E/size of rectangular field)%(1e9+7). 

Input:- First line contains 3 space-separated integer-N,D,Q. Next D lines contain 5 space-separated integers as explained above.Next Q lines contain 4 space-separated  integers as explained above.

Output:- Q lines,each containing the answer to the query i.e. (E/size of rectangular field)%(1e9+7).
